to discuss and collaborate on [GitHub][GitHub]! Our team is maintaining this repo

### Discussions
Discussions are where we have conversations.

If you'd like help troubleshooting a PR you're working on, have a great new idea, or want to share something amazing you've learned in our docs, join us in [discussions][Discussions].

### Issues
Issues are used to track tasks that contributors can help with. 

If you've found bug, or something in the content of the documentation that should be updated,
search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an issue. We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.
