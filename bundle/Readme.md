Developer directory
===================

Special directory to start local copy of NOC.

`run.sh` - init script. init done on top of docker-compose 1.8 
`bindle.sh` - init script. init done on top of `docker services`
`clear.sh` - cleanup script. removes everything. and db's too.
`nomad` - directory with nomad scheduler jobs. have to see again after > 0.6
`scrips` - directory with migration and init scripts.

It is expected that project layout must be
projects/noc
projects/noc_data
