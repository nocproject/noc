# 0.6.4

## Migration

Rename max_pull_config parameter in `etc/noc-activator.conf` to max_scripts

# Common

## noc-schedule daemon

Periodic task handling moved from SAE to a new noc-schedule daemon,
improving overall SAE stability. Custom pyRules can be launched as
common periodic tasks, allowing deep NOC customization.

## contrib/

contrib/ directory contains updated versions of following packages:

- Django 1.3
- Sphinx 1.0.7

## sendmail method

noc-notifier supports new "sendmail" method, allowing to spool new
messages directly to local mail-agent queue. This method is compatible
with nullmailer. It also can be used to spool messages to arbitrary
scripts.

## PEP8 compliance

Large amont of python modules are reformatted according to PEP8
proposal.

## Clean up forgotten map-reduce tasks

main.cleanup periodic task also removes hanging Map/Reduce tasks data.

## Prefix Tables

Prefix Tables are named lists of IPv4/IPv6 prefixes, which can be used
for configuration purposes in many places. 0.6.4 release allows to use
Prefix Tables in Managed Objects Selectors

# Service Activation

## SA Sharding

Service Activation subsystem can be split into several independenting
shards, each having dedicated activators and SAE daemons. Sharding opens
new ways for horizontal scaling of large installations. In addition,
shard can be put offline, disabling only part of SA subsystem for
maintainance.

## WRR load balancing

Activator reports its capabilities (including script session limits) to
SAE on connect. SAE uses weighted round-robin (WRR) balancing scheme to
proportionally distribute the load between activators in the pool.

## Command Snippets

Command Snippets are canned parametrized templates for frequenly-used
operations, which can be run multiple times on large amount of
equipment.

## Script output templating

Scripts launched from Managed Object's script form now utilize neat HTML
templates with additional hot actions links.

## Input encodings

Treat Managed Object's \_[encoding]() attribute as input encoding
specification

## Per-object concurrent scripts limit

Managed Object's \_[max_scripts]() attribute is used as per-object
concurrent scripts limit

## max_pull_config renamed

noc-activator's max_pull_config parameter is renamed to less
obsfucated max_scripts

## Larger remote_path

ManagementObject.remote_path can be up to 256 characters

## API improvements

- Profile.shutdown_session() - profiles can use scriptable session
  shutdowns, similar to start_session()
- ManagedObject.scripts - all scripts can be accessed directly via
  .scripts property

## New profiles

- ZTE.ZXR10

## New interfaces

- IGetHTTPGet
- IGetLicense
- IGetSNMPGet
- IGetSNMPGetNext

## New scripts

- EdgeCore.ES.get_switchport
- Force10.FTOS.ping
- Generic.get_http_get
- Generic.get_snmp_get
- Generic.get_snmp_getnext
- f5.BIGIP.get_arp
- f5.BIGIP.get_licence
- f5.BIGIP.ping

## Compatibility

Better compatibility for:

- D-Link DGS-3120 Series
- Cisco Catalyst 2950

## get_version optional attributes

get_version can return additional named attributes

## Non-blocking HTTP client

Non-blocking http client introduced for accurate timeout handling

## ssh: keyboard-interactive method

Built-in ssh daemon can authenticate using keyboard-interactive method

## f5.BIGIP uses bash

f5 devices must be configured to use advanced shell (bash) for noc user.

## Event filters are refreshed on object's address changed

Event filters are reloaded immediately when managed object's addresses
are changed, reducing amount of Invalid event filter events

## Bugfixes

- Prevent recursive selectors creation
- Unicode logging issues
- Error handling in HTTP
- Better handling of Telnet/SSH connection timeout

# Configuration Management

## "Get now" retrieves config immediately

"Get now" admin action immediately refetches selected configs instead of
rescheduling next pull

## Filter by "Administrative domain"

"Administrative domain" filter is added to config list pane

# DNS

## Flexible zone changes notifications

Multi-level DNS Zone changes notifications are introduced. Notification
Group used to report zone changes calculated in following order: First,
try to use DNS Zone's group, if set. For empty DNS Zone's group try to
use one from DNS Zone profile. Finally, if no group is set for profile,
use system's notification group

## .ip6.arpa zones treated as IPv6 reverse

.ip6.arpa zones are treated as usual IPv6 reverse zones
