# 0.7.1

## New release schedule

Starting with 0.7 branch the release schedule has been change. We have
introduced additional interim releases (every few weeks) between full
releases. Interim releases represents points of relative stability, when
new features are implemented and worked as expected, while not all
features for new release is implemented yet. So the user can decide
which version is to use in production: relatively stable interim, when
new features are required, or stay on latest release. Learn more about
[new versioning scheme](https://kb.nocproject.org/display/DOC/NOC+Versions)

## Migration

mongodb 1.8 or later and pymongo 1.1 or later are required. Install them
according to your operation system policy. Then:

1.  Create mongodb user for NOC:

        /opt/noc$ mongo
        MongoDB shell version: 1.8.2
        connecting to: test
        > use noc
        > db.addUser("noc", "password")

2.  Change \[nosql\] section of etc/noc.conf. Refer to noc.conf
    reference for details.

3.  FastCGI daemon noc-fcgi was replaced by full-blown HTTP server
    noc-web. You may need to change your HTTP server configuration from
    FastCGI to reverse proxy. Refer to the "Webserver Setup" reference
    for instructions

4.  Finish the update as usually:

        /opt/noc$ ./scripts/post-update

## Infrastructure changes

### New site and collaboration services

Quickly growing DevTeam demands new approaches and tools. As a result,
new site and collaboration services, including Jira, Confluence, FishEye
and Jenkins are introduced to community. See "New services on
nocproject.org" for details.

### New logo

Project got new official logo. See
[New project's logo](https://kb.nocproject.org/display/SITE/2011/10/22/New+Project%27s+Logo)
for details.

### New UI

NOC gots a new [ExtJS4](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/) web ui,
offering desktop-like look and feel and rich sets of widgets. See 
[ExtJS examples](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/examples/) for details.

### REST/JSON interface

NOC Client-to-server communications changing. New UI uses REST/JSON
interface, open to third-party applications.

### PEP8 code formatting convenctions

A lot of Python sources has been reformatted according to PEP8

### Continuous integration and testing

Continuous integration system has been introduced, testing each commit
against over 1800 unittests

### noc-web daemon

flup-based FastCGI daemon noc-fcgi has been replaced with Tornado -
based noc-web HTTP-server. See "Webserver Setup" for details

### MS Active Directory authentication backend

New AD authentication backend can be used to integrate NOC into existing
MS Windows domains. See noc.conf for details:

    ./noc shortcut
    /opt/noc$ python manage.py ...
    and
    /opt/noc$ ./noc ...

are the same

### kevent polling method fixed

kevent polling method works on both FreeBSD and Mac OS X systems

## Service Activation

### MRT throttling

max_mrt_rate_per_sae and max_mrt_rate_per_shard noc-sae.conf
parameters can be used to limit script starting rate to avoid excessive
load on centralized AAA infrastructures

### Better MRT scheduling

Adaptive MRT timeout calculation and smart map task scheduling help to
avoid the spikes of load and distribute tasks more evenly

### MRT logging

mrt_log noc-sae.conf parameters enables additional MRT logging into
separate CSV files in the &lt;logdir&gt;/mrt directory

### ./noc versioninventory

New versioninventory CLI tool available:

    /opt/noc$ ./noc versioninventory @selector

### Command Snippets improvements

- Snippets got additional Ignore CLI errors option to silently ignore
  CLI errors during snippet execution
- Managed Objects access permissions are counted when running new
  snippet

### SAE-Activator protocol protection

SAE-Activator RPC protocol got optional ssh-like protection to
encrypt/verify and compress transmitted data

- Zebra.Zebra: Zebra.Zebra.get_version
- ZyXEL.ZyNOS: Zyxel.ZyNOS.get_interface_status,
  Zyxel.ZyNOS.get_portchannel, Zyxel.ZyNOS.get_switchport

### Script improvements

- SNMP support for Alcatel.OS62xx.get_version,
  DLink.DxS.get_version, DLink.DxS.get_interface_status,
  Huawei.VRP.get_version
- Cisco.IOS.get_spanning_tree recognises ports in ALTERNATE state
- Cisco.IOS.get_lldp_neighbors properly detets disabled LLDP
- HP.ProCurve.get_spanning_tree gots RSTP mode support
- DLink.DxS restores CLI pager status on exit
- DLink.DxS got SIM support

- Fine grained script result caching: with self.cached(): and
  self.cli/self.snmp.get\* cached= parameters
- New interfaces: IGetObjectsStatus, IGetIfIndex, IGetBFDSession
- Profile.get_linecard() method

### Fault Management

NOC gots a new Fault Management implementation with event correlation
and root cause analysis. New implementation follows rule-based approach
and backed by high-performance mongodb database and cabable to collect,
analyze and correlate more than 500 events per second per node. Built-in
rule set trained to analyze 189 types of network events and detect 77
types of network problems on commonly used network platforms. Built in
rule set can easily be extended and trained.

FM now can use 
[Precompiled MIBs](http://kb.nocproject.org/display/BLOGS/2011/11/26/Precompiled+MIBs)

### IP Address Management (IPAM)

- Do not ping broadcast addresses

### Peering Management

- Interactive prefix-list builder has been rewritten to new UI
- ARIN database support
- Client cone analysis
- Prefix-list builder now uses mongodb cache and works about 3 times
  faster

### DNS Management
