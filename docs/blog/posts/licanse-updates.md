# NOC License Update: What You Need to Know

We are making an important change to the licensing of NOC. Starting from 2025,
NOC will continue to be open source but with additional restrictions on the creation
and distribution of derivative products.

<!-- more -->

## Key Changes

- **Derivative products require authorization** – Any development of software based on NOC
  now requires explicit written approval from Gufo Labs.
- **Commercial distribution control** – Any derivative product intended for distribution,
  especially in a commercial context, must receive prior written consent.
- **Prohibition of unauthorized competing solutions** – Using NOC or its derivatives to create competing commercial solutions without authorization is strictly prohibited.

## Why This Change?

For years, Gufo Labs has supported NOC’s development, covering infrastructure and maintenance costs.
These changes ensure that NOC remains free for companies while preventing unauthorized
commercial exploitation of the software.

## Impact on Users

* **If you use NOC as-is**, nothing changes. You can continue using and deploying it freely.
* **If you plan to modify and distribute NOC**, you must obtain permission from Gufo Labs.
* **If you provide a commercial service based on NOC**, you need explicit authorization.

These changes help maintain the integrity of NOC as an open platform while ensuring
fair use and sustainable development. If you have questions or require authorization,
contact us at Gufo Labs.

## Updated License

The updated version of the NOC license is now available at [license]. The new license includes important additions, including:

- **Section 4**: Derivative products are defined as any software or service based on NOC.
  Modifications or any commercial service that uses NOC beyond basic usage require permission.
- **Section 5**: Any creation or distribution of derivative products, especially commercial ones,
  requires explicit prior authorization from Gufo Labs.
- **Section 6**: NOC cannot be used to develop or sell competing commercial solutions,
  including SaaS or modified versions, without explicit permission from Gufo Labs.

Please review the updated license to ensure compliance with the new terms.
