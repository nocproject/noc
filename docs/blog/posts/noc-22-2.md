# NOC 22.2

22.2 release contains [286](https://code.getnoc.com/noc/noc/merge_requests?scope=all&state=merged&milestone_title=22.2) bugfixes, optimisations and improvements.

## Highlights

### Gufo Labs Collaboration

[Gufo Labs](https://gufolabs.com/) is a private IT-consulting company based in Milan, Italy.
Among other things, they focus on extracting the vital parts of the NOC technologies,
reworking them, and releasing them as separate open-source packages. Separation into 
independent packages allows a focus on API, documentation, reliability, portability, resource usage, and performance. 

Known as [Gufo Stack](https://gufolabs.com/products/gufo-stack/), this software is the valuable
tool not only for NOC but every network-related engineer and developer.

### ETL

ETL system got the ability to fetch data incrementally. Depending on the remote system, ETL can request only changed data. It reduces imposed load and allows reducing of the synchronization intervals.

Additionally, ETL now can extract and load Managed Object's capabilities.

### MX

MX service got the ability to route and process messages based on labels. To reduce the
system resource usage, parts of `mx` service can be integrated directly in the producers'
processes.

The Fault Management got the ability to mirror the messages to the `mx`, allowing
real-time export to the Kafka. `syslogcollector` can mirror incoming syslog messages,
`trapcollector` can mirror semi-parsed SNMP Trap PDUs, while `classifier`
can mirror the classified messages. This greatly increases the NOC's capability
to pump the Data Lakes and all the other's "Big Data" stuff.

### Metrics service

After several profiling sessions, the `metrics` service requires much less CPU and memory.

### Ping

`NOC` has switched to the [Gufo Ping](https://docs.gufolabs.com/gufo_ping/). Gufo Ping is the
successor of the NOC's Cython-accelerated ping implementation. Compared to the previous
implementation it has distinctive features:

* Implemented in [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org) using [pyo3](https://pyo3.rs/) bindings.
* Memory and CPU optimized.
* 100% test coverage.
* Built-in benchmarks.
* Reduced context switches.
* Reduced python-to-binary switches.
* Applies BPF filter to separate concurrent ping processes.
* Packaged as binary wheels for the major platforms.

### Python

Python 3.7 support is deprecated, leaving support for 3.8-3.10.

### Internals

* `tornado` has been removed from all critical paths. Next version will remove
  explicit `tornado` requirements.
