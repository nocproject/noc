# NOC Project is Now Managed by Gufo Labs

We’re making an important change: from now on, **[Gufo Labs][Gufo Labs]** officially owns and manages the **NOC Project**.  

<!-- more -->
## Why?
Gufo Labs was created by the original authors of NOC. For years, it has supported the project, covered all infrastructure costs, and worked with partners who helped fund development. Now, to make things clearer and more structured, all rights and responsibilities for NOC are officially transferred to Gufo Labs.  

## What Does This Mean for You?

- **For users:** Nothing changes—you can keep using NOC as before. It remains open-source and free.  
- **For contributors:** You can still modify NOC and create your own versions for personal or internal use. However, commercial distribution of modified versions now requires **Gufo Labs' approval.**

## **What’s Next?**  
We’re updating the [licence] to reflect these changes. This ensures that NOC stays free to use, while Gufo Labs manages its future development and protects it from unauthorized forks.  

If you have questions, feel free to reach out. Thanks for being part of the NOC community!
