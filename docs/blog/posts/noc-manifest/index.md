## Announcing the New NOC Manifest: A Vision for the Future of Network Management

We are thrilled to introduce the updated NOC Manifest, a comprehensive document that outlines our vision, goals, and core principles for the NOC Project. As a community-driven open-source initiative, we aim to lead the market in providing top-tier OSS solutions for data networks. Our new manifest serves as a guiding light for our mission and an invitation for telecom operators, enterprises, developers, and service companies to join us in revolutionizing network management.

### Who Are We?

Our team is an international coalition of recognized experts in the design, planning, and operation of communication networks and online services. We are united by a shared passion for innovation and a commitment to creating solutions that empower users around the world. Our expertise spans multiple domains, and we leverage this collective knowledge to build robust, flexible, and scalable network management tools.

### Our Goals

At the heart of our manifest are ambitious yet attainable goals designed to propel us to the forefront of the industry. Our primary objective is to become the leading OSS solution for data networks, surpassing both open-source and commercial products. We strive to cover essential areas such as Network Resource Inventory, Fault Management, Performance Analysis, Configuration Management, and more.

In addition to leading the market, we aim to develop an integrated and comprehensive environment for our target domains. Our solutions are designed to be extensible and flexible, ensuring adaptability to various use cases. User-friendliness is a cornerstone of our approach, and we are dedicated to making our products intuitive and accessible.

A crucial aspect of our vision is fostering collaboration. We seek to unite telecom operators, large enterprises, and service companies to establish industry standards and formalize best practices for network management. By supporting an active community of developers and users, we facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration, driving continuous improvement and innovation.

### Our Users

Our solutions cater to a diverse range of users, including telecom operators (from small to national), enterprise clients, campuses, educational institutions, data centers, service companies, and online projects. This wide user base reflects the versatility and scalability of our tools, which can adapt to various network management needs.

### Our Virtues

The NOC Project is built on a foundation of core principles that guide our development and operations:

1. **Open-source**: All project source codes are open and available under the BSD license. Our products can be used for free, promoting accessibility and transparency.
2. **Vendor-agnostic**: Our solutions work seamlessly with equipment from different vendors, ensuring flexibility and independence.
3. **Inventory First**: Effective monitoring and management start with accurate inventory. We prioritize maintaining up-to-date inventory information.
4. **Discovery**: Our inventory database is continuously populated and reconciled with the actual network state.
5. **Policy-based Management**: Policies, rather than individual configurations, define monitoring and management once inventory information is aligned.
6. **Single Point of Truth**: Our system provides reliable and accurate information about assets and their current state.
7. **Scalability**: The system scales from small labs to networks with millions of elements, accommodating various sizes and complexities.
8. **Ease of Development**: We use standard, widely-adopted tools to facilitate development and integration.
9. **Collaborative Solution**: We address common network operation issues through collaboration, leveraging the collective expertise of our community.
