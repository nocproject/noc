# Introducing Our Revamped Telegram Group: Now in English and Russian!

At NOC, we are excited to announce a significant update to our official Telegram group! Our dedicated team has been hard at work, revamping the group to provide you with an even better experience. We are proud to present a brand new thematic group, now available in both English and Russian languages.

## Why the Revamp?

As part of our commitment to our community, we wanted to create a more inclusive and engaging space for NOC enthusiasts around the world. While our original group served as a hub for networking and discussions, we saw an opportunity to make it even better.

3. **Dedicated Moderation**: We have a team of dedicated moderators to ensure that the group maintains a friendly and respectful atmosphere. Their role is to facilitate discussions, answer questions, and ensure that everyone feels welcome.
