# Project Augeas: Unifying NOC Documentation

At NOC, we are currently revamping our documentation with "Project Augeas" 
to provide a better experience for our users.

## The Challenge

Previously, our documentation was split into English and Russian sections, 
which were not consistent with each other and had excessively complex structures.
Worse, a large part of the documentation was still hosted on the old Confluence system.
As a result, it was hard for users to get the required information, and hard for
developers to keep documentation in tune.

## What We Are Doing

- **Merging and Cleaning**: We are consolidating and cleaning up the English and Russian sections for consistency and accuracy.

- **Website Integration**: We are merging our documentation site with the main site to create a unified documentation and information portal.

## The Result

- One Place for All: You will find everything about NOC in one place, whether you're a beginner or an advanced user.

- Language Flexibility: We now offer documentation in both English and Russian.

Our goal with "Project Augeas" is to provide a smoother, more organized, and unified documentation experience.

!!! note "Trivia"

    In Greek mythology, Augeas was a king of Elis. He is known for his stables, 
    which housed the single greatest number of cattle in the country and had never been cleaned, 
    until the time of the great hero Heracles.

Stay tuned for more updates and improvements as we continue to enhance NOC's documentation.
