# Welcome to the New Site

[NOC development team](/devteam/) proudly presents new project's site.
New site location is https://getnoc.com/. Site is built by
excellent [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) site generator and based
on heavily modified [Hugo Universal theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-universal-theme/).
Source codes and build infrastructure are open-source and located
at [getnoc.com repo](https://code.getnoc.com/noc/getnoc.com).

All photo content on the site is user-contributed and we say thanks to
our dear colleagues.

Old site, http://nocproject.org/ is still online, though no longer maintained.

PS: The Cat is the fellow member of [DevTeam](/devteam/). His name is [Markes](/members/markes/),
he is british shorthair (BRIa). _"The NOC is working, the Cat is sleeping"_.
