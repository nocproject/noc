# Resource Group

Resource Groups are part of Logical Inventory, allowing arbitrary
relations between NOC's entities based on Producer-Consumer model.
Resource Groups use [Technologies](../technology/index.md) to define
particular kind of services and affected types of entities.

Resource Groups can be used to organize and group entities and
to establish relations.
