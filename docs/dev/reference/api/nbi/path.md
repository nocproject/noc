# NBI path API

NBI path API allows to trace possible paths in discovered network
topology considering extra constraints.

## Usage

### By Object Level

Specify path end by reaching Managed Object [Level](../../../../user/reference/concepts/managed-object-profile/index.md#level)
greater than specified.

## Path Config Specification

Path Config specified as value of `config` request key.

```
{
    "max_depth": 10,

* `max_depth` - Restrict search depth up to `max_depth` nodes.
* `n_shortest` - Return up to `n_shortest` paths.



## Path Constraints Specification

Path Constraints are specified as value of `constraints` request key.

### Explicit VLAN

```
{
    "vlan": {
        "vlan": 1234,
        "strict": false
    }
}
```

Restrict paths to links having VLAN `1234`, either tagged or untagged.
`strict` parameter enforces additional checking:

* `true` - VLAN must be present on both sides of the link.
* `false` - VLAN must be present at least on one side of the link.

### Implicit VLAN

```
{
    "vlan": {
        "interface_untagged": true,
        "strict": true
    }
}
```

Get untagged vlan from start of path interface and restrict path
to links having this VLAN, either tagged or untagged.

`strict` parameter enforces additional checking:

* `true` - VLAN must be present on both sides of the link.
* `false` - VLAN must be present at least on one side of the link.

### Upward Direction

```
{
    "upwards": true
}
```

Forces upward direction of path.
i.e. Managed Object [Level](../../../../user/reference/concepts/managed-object-profile/index.md#level)
of each next object of the path may not be less that level of current
object. Effectively speed-ups path finding by denying descending to
lower levels of networks.
