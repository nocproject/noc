# Explanations

Explanation, or discussions, _clarify and illuminate a particular topic_. They
broaden the documentation’s coverage of a topic.

They are **understanding-oriented**.

Explanations can equally well be described as discussions; they are discursive
in nature. They are a chance for the documentation to relax and step back from
the software, taking a wider view, illuminating it from a higher level or even
from different perspectives. You might imagine a discussion document being read
at leisure, rather than over the code.

This section of documentation is rarely explicitly created, and instead,
snippets of explanation are scattered amongst other sections. Sometimes, the
section exists, but has a name such as _Background_ or _Other notes_ or _Key
topics_ - these names are not always useful.

Discussions are less easy to create than it might seem - things that are
straightforward to explain when you have the starting-point of someone’s
question are less easy when you have a blank page and have to write down
something about it.

A topic isn’t defined by a specific task you want to achieve, like a how-to
guide, or what you want the user to learn, like a tutorial. It’s not defined by
a piece of the machinery, like reference material. It’s defined by what you
think is a reasonable area to try to cover at one time, so the division of
topics for discussion can sometimes be a little arbitrary.

## Provide context

**Explanations are the place for background and context** - for example, SNMP requests
and how they are handled in NOC.

They can also explain why things are so - design decisions, historical reasons,
technical constraints.

## Discuss alternatives and opinions

**Explanation can consider alternatives**, or multiple different approaches to the
same question. For example, in an article on Django deployment, it would be
appropriate to consider and evaluate different web server options,

Discussions can even consider and weigh up contrary opinions - for example,
whether test modules should be in a package directory, or not.

## Don’t instruct, or provide technical reference

**Explanation should do things that the other parts of the documentation do not**.
It’s not the place of an explanation to instruct the user in how to do
something. Nor should it provide technical description. These functions of
documentation are already taken care of in other sections.
