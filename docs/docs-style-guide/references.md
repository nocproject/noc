# References

Reference guides are _technical descriptions of the machinery_ and how to
operate it.

Reference guides have one job only: to describe. They are code-determined,
because ultimately that’s what they describe: key classes, functions, APIs, and
so they should list things like functions, fields, attributes and methods, and
set out how to use them.

Reference material is **information-oriented**.

By all means technical reference can contain examples to illustrate usage, but
it should not attempt to explain basic concepts, or how to achieve common tasks.

Reference material should be **austere and to the point**.

Note that description **does** include basic description of how to use the
machinery - how to instantiate a particular class, or invoke a certain method,
for example, or precautions that must be taken when passing something to a
function. However, this is simply part of its function as technical reference,
and emphatically **not** to be confused with a how-to guide - describing correct
usage of software (technical reference) is not the same as showing how to use it
to achieve a certain end (how-to documentation).

For some developers, reference guides are the only kind of documentation they
can imagine. They already understand their software, they know how to use it.
All they can imagine that other people might need is technical information about
it.

Reference material tends to be written well. It can even - to some extent - be
generated automatically, but this is never sufficient on its own.

## Structure the documentation around the code

**Give reference documentation the same structure as the codebase**, so that the
user can navigate both the code and the documentation for it at the same time.
This will also help the maintainers see where reference documentation is missing
or needs to be updated.

## Be consistent

**In reference guides, structure, tone, format must all be consistent** - as
consistent as those of an encyclopaedia or dictionary.

## Do nothing but describe

**The only job of technical reference is to describe**, as clearly and completely as
possible. Anything else (explanation, discussion, instruction, speculation,
opinion) is not only a distraction, but will make it harder to use and maintain.
Provide examples to illustrate the description when appropriate.

Avoid the temptation to use reference material to instruct in how to achieve
things, beyond the basic scope of using the software, and don’t allow
explanations of concepts or discussions of topics to develop. Instead, link to
how-to guides, explanation and introductory tutorials as appropriate.

## Be accurate

**These descriptions must be accurate and kept up-to-date**. Any discrepancy between
the machinery and your description of it will inevitably lead a user astray.
