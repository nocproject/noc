# 0.5

## Migration

Before performing any operation on NOC upgrade be sure:

- You have mercurial 1.3 or later
- python's system path contain no _protobuf_ or _south_

With 0.5 release new application permission system introduced, leaving old
Django permissions obsolete. You need to reassing user permissions after upgrade.

## General

### New site

All NOC resources gathered together into single site:
http://redmine.nocproject.org/projects/noc

### New Application Framework

0.5 release is a major step towards open telecom application platform. New
django-based application framework supports common development patterns
while containing a lot of telecom-related features. Web interface was completely
rewritten as a set of applications.

Four basic application classes are introduced:

- Applications - common application
- ModelApplication - wrapper for django's ModelAdmin, integrating django-based code in new framework
- Reports - common reporting engine
- SAApplication - Service Activation application wrapping map/reduce tasks

Each application define own set of permissions for granular access. Unittests included with every application,
helping to maintain code quality

### Django 1.2 migration

0.5 release based on Django 1.2, so all Django 1.2 enhancements immediately accessible from NOC applications.

### New and updated third-party software in contrib/

contrib/ directory of 0.5 contains new packages
