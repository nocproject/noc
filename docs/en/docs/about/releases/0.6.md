# Address Space Management

With 0.6 release NOC got new IPv4/IPv6 IPAM application. Common changes
are:

- New data model
- Address Family (AFI) is used to distinguish between IPv4/IPv6
- VRFs got additional attributes: IPv4 and IPv6 address families. You
  can manually enable IPv4, IPv6 or both for each VRF
- You can use visual styles (Main &gt; Setup &gt; Styles) to gain
  different VRFs, prefixes and addresses different visual appearance
- IPv6 online ping works like IPv4 one. You need to set fping6 path in
  noc-activator.conf
- IPv6 addresses can be used in SA scripts
- IPv6 addresses are integrated into DNS just like IPv4 one
- lib/ip.py got new object IP and used in all IP address manipulation
- "Show Free Addresses" function is optimized and works regardless of
  the block size
- Multi-line descriptions. Only first line shown in the list, while
  full description available in previews
- New color-schema generator for Address Ranges
- Address ranges can overlap. Though you cannot overlap locked ranges,
  you can use overlapped non-locked ranges for documentation issues
- Django templates are used for FQDN generation in address ranges

# Configuration Management

- cm.pull_config task rescheduled immediately when "Get now" config
  admin action used

# Fault Management

## Delayed "Invalid Event Source" messages

"Invalid Event Source" messages are generated only once per minute per
IP

## Activatior Speedups

Due to database interation optimization, 0.6 release got up to 50%
performance gain to noc-activator
