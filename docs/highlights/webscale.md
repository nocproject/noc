# WebScale

The NOC is built with scalability in mind. NOC is light enough
to serve small lab network for learning purposes, while its
scalable enough to serve world's largest networks.
[Microservices Architecture](microservices.md) relies
on commodity workhorses - servers providing CPU, RAM, Disk space and IOPS.
Just add more more nodes and support your network's growth.
