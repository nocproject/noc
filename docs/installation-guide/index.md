# Installation Guide

The NOC system offers flexibility in installation,
allowing you to choose the installation method that best suits your requirements:

1. **[Using Gufo Thor:](install-using-gufo-thor.md)**

    - Quick system evaluation, testing, and development.
    - Requires Docker.
    - Installs on the user's computer.

2. **Using Virtual Appliance:**

    - Quick system evaluation and small productive usage (less than 1000 network elements).
    - Requires a virtualization system such as KVM, ESXi, VirtualBox, etc.

3. **Using Tower:**

    - Most complex method for flexible cluster configuration.
    - Suitable for networks of any size.
    - Requires primal [NOC services](../services-reference/index.md) knowledge.
    - Requires Docker for Tower.
    - Requires one or more bare-metal hosts or virtual machines.

Choose the method that aligns with your use case and follow
the respective instructions for a seamless NOC installation.
