## Our Virtues

## Our Virtues

Our project is built on the following core principles:

1. **Open-source**: All project source codes are open and available under the [BSD license](../license.md).
2. **Vendor-agnostic**: Our solution works seamlessly with equipment from different vendors. Beyond the integration layer, the system core is vendor-independent.
3. **Inventory First**: Effective monitoring and management start with accurate inventory. We focus on maintaining up-to-date inventory information.
4. **Discovery**: Our inventory database is continually populated and reconciled with the actual network state.
5. **Policy-based Management**: Policies, rather than individual configurations, define monitoring and management once inventory information is aligned.
6. **Single Point of Truth**: Our system provides accurate, reliable information about assets and their current state.
7. **Scalability**: The system scales from small labs to networks with millions of elements.
8. **Ease of Development**: We use standard, widely-adopted tools for ease of development.
9. **Collaborative Solution**: We address common network operation issues through collaboration.
