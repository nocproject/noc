# NOC Community

The official NOC community unites people with a common goal:

* Using NOC to solve practical problems.
* Developing NOC in the direction outlined by the [NOC Manifest](../noc-manifest/index.md).

The community has a hierarchical structure and consists of four entities:

1. [NOC Foundation](foundation.md)
2. [Steering Council](steering-council.md)
3. [Core Team](core-team.md)
4. [Users](users.md)
