# NOC Manifest

## Who Are We?

We are an [international team](../noc-community/index.md) of recognized experts in the design, planning, and operation of communication networks and online services.

## Our Goal

1. Become the leading OSS solution for data networks among open-source and commercial products, including but not limited to:

    * Network Resource Inventory
    * Fault Management
    * Performance Analysis
    * Configuration Management
    * Network Management System (NMS) and Element Management System (EMS)
    * Trail Management
    * Provisioning and Service Activation

2. Create an integrated and comprehensive environment for target domains.
3. Provide an extensible and flexible solution adaptable to various use scenarios.
4. Make the product intuitive and user-friendly.
5. Unite telecom operators, large enterprise users, and service companies to establish an industry standard and formalize best practices for network management.
6. Support an active community of developers and users for knowledge and experience sharing.

## Our Users

1. Telecom operators — from small to national.
2. Enterprise clients.
3. Campuses.
4. Educational institutions.
5. Data centers.
6. Service companies.
7. Online projects.

## Our Virtues

1. **Open-source** — all project source codes are open and available under the [BSD license](../license.md). The product can be used for free.
2. **Vendor-agnostic** — our solution works equally well with equipment from different vendors. Beyond the integration layer, the system core is vendor-independent.
3. **Inventory First** — effective monitoring and management are impossible without proper inventory. We focus on inventory information and ways to keep it up to date.
4. **Discovery** — the inventory database is populated and reconciled with the actual network state.
5. **Policy-based management** — no need to configure monitoring for each element individually. Once inventory information is aligned, policies define what and how to monitor and manage.
6. **Single point of truth** — the system is the source of true and accurate information about assets and their current state.
7. **Scalability** — the system scales from simple labs with a few devices to networks with millions of elements.
8. **Ease of development** — standard and widely used tools are utilized.
9. **Collaborative solution** for common network operation issues.
