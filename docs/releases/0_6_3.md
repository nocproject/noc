# 0.6.3

## Migration pycrypto is required in order to migrate to 0.6.3.

Install pycrypto as:

```
easy_install pycrypto
```

## General

## Pluggable polling methods

lib/nbsocket.py uses pluggable polling method. In addition to the
classic select(), poll() and epoll() methods are implemented. Polling
method is set into etc/noc.conf:\[main\]/polling_method configuration
variable.

# Service Activation

## New profiles

- H3C.VRP

## New scripts

- HP.ProCurve9xxx.get_arp
- HP.ProCurve9xxx.get_fqdn
- HP.ProCurve9xxx.get_interfaces
- HP.ProCurve9xxx.get_spanning_tree
- Huawei.VRP.get_interface_status
- Juniper.JUNOS.get_interfaces
- OS.FreeBSD.get_vlans
- Zyxel.ZyNOS.add_vlan
- Zyxel.ZyNOS.remove_vlan

## New interfaces

- IGetFDPNeighbors
- IConfigNotifyFilter

## API enhancements

- command_exit works properly
- Profile.start_session() allows to write sophisticated session
  setups
- ScriptTest.ignore_timestamp_mismatch

## Topology Discovery

New method: Foundry Discovery Protocol (FDP)

## debug-script enhancements

- Parallel execution on several management objects
- Script results are dumped at the end of log
- `selector:<name>` construction can be used instead of managed
  object's name

## Pure-python telnet and ssh clients implementation

pure-Python telnet and ssh2 clients are implemented. PTYs are no longer
needed for noc-activator. CLI session limit can be significantly
increased as result.

## Cisco Catalyst clusters support

Catalyst cluster members can be set up as separate management objects
using /cluster:&lt;id&gt;/ \_[Path]().

## UI improvements

- Show only used device profiles into Management Object's filter.
- Show platform and model in management objects list.

## Other

Serious speed optimization and reduced memory footprint for
noc-activator

# Address Space Management

## Import Connected

0.6.3 release introduces new ip.routeimport application, which allows to
import directly connected networks from equipment into IPAM database

# DNS Management

DNS Zone name can be up 255 characters long, offering enough place to
hold IPv6 reverse zones

# Configuration Management

Management Object's Config Diff Filter Rule allows to remove
insignificant config changes from email notifications
