    easy_install pycrypto

General
=======

Pluggable polling methods
-------------------------

lib/nbsocket.py uses pluggable polling method. In addition
to the classic select(), poll() and epoll() methods are implemented.
Polling method is set into etc/noc.conf:[main]/polling_method configuration
variable.

Service Activation
==================

New profiles
------------

* H3C.VRP

New scripts

* HP.ProCurve9xxx.get_fqdn
* HP.ProCurve9xxx.get_interfaces
* HP.ProCurve9xxx.get_spanning_tree
* Huawei.VRP.get_interface_status
* Juniper.JUNOS.get_interfaces
* OS.FreeBSD.get_vlans
* Zyxel.ZyNOS.add_vlan
* Zyxel.ZyNOS.remove_vlan

New interfaces
--------------

Topology Discovery
------------------
New method: Foundry Discovery Protocol (FDP)

debug-script enhancements

using /cluster:<id>/ _Path_.

UI improvements
---------------

* Show only used device profiles into Management Object's filter.
