            		 and DHCP ACK packets)).
            		 
            		 The auto-learned IP-MAC binding entry will be mapped to a specific 
            		 source port based on the MAC address learning function. This entry 
            		 will be created as an ACL-mode binding entry for this specific port. 
            		 Each entry is associated with a lease time. When the lease time 
            		 expires, the expired entry will be removed from this port. The 
            		 automatically learned binding entry can be moved from one port to 
            		 another port if the DHCP snooping function has learned that the MAC 
            		 address is moved to a different port.
            		 
			 Consider a case where DHCP snooping learns a binding entry, and the 
			 same IP-MAC binding entry has been statically configured. Suppose 
			 that the learned information is consistent with the statically 
			 configured entry, then the automatically learned entry will not be 
			 created. Supposing that the entry is statically configured in ARP 
			 mode, since the automatically learned entry will be created in ACL 
			 mode, the entry will become ACL mode. Supposing that the entry is 
			 statically configured on one port and the entry is automatically 
			 learned on another port, then both entries will exist.
			 
			 When the dhcp_snoop function is disabled, all of the automatically 
			 learned binding entries will be removed.
