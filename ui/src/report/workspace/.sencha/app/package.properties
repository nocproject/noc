# =============================================================================
# This file provides an override point for default variables defined in 
# package.defaults.properties. These properties are only imported when building
# for the "package" environment.
#
# Properties defined in this file take priority over build.properties but are
# only loaded for "package" builds.
#
# NOTE: This use of "package" applies to native packaged application, not a
# Package in the general since of code libraries.
